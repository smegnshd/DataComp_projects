    "In this exercise, we'll use a dataset that contains information about 227 countries. This dataset has lots of interesting information on each country, such as the country's birth rates, death rates, and its gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the value of all the goods and services produced in a year, expressed as dollars per person.\n",

    "We've created three lists of data from this dataset to get you started. gdp is a list that contains the value of GDP per country, expressed as dollars per person. phones is a list of the number of mobile phones per 1,000 people in that country. Finally, percent_literate is a list that contains the percent of each country's population that can read and write."
