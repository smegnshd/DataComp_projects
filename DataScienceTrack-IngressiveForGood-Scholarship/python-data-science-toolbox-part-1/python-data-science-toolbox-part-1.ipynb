    "# Strings in Python\n",

    "\n",
    "company = 'DataCamp'\n",
    "You've also learned to use the operations + and * with strings. Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together, while the * concatenates multiple copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the + and * operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the following code in the shell:\n",
